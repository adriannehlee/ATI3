<h1>Making an Access to Information or Personal Information request online</h1>
<p><a href="home.html"><input type="button" value="Previous"></a></p>
<p>You will be directed through a series of steps to provide the details of your request. Depending on whether you are seeking government information or personal information, the steps may differ.</p>
	<p>
	Once you have submitted your online request, it will be sent to the desired institution for processing. Institutions are required to process standard requests within 30 days. If your request is incomplete, requires clarification, or requires additional time for processing an ATIP officer from the desired institution will contact you directly.
</p>
<h2>Steps to make a government information request:</h2>
<p>Below is an overview of the steps to completing a government information request using the online system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search completed requests: Before submitting your own request, you will be directed to search prior completed requests to see if the government has already released the information you want to request. If you do find what you are looking for, you can request the completed request instead of creating a new one. Asking for a completed request is often quicker than making a new request, as the request has already been processed and the files are ready for release. If you choose to create a new request, you will continue through the following steps.</li>
<li>Select the institution: You will be asked to specify the institution you wish to ask for information.</li>
<li>Login, register or proceed as guest: You will be asked to either register (if you make requests regularly), login (if you registered previously) or proceed as a guest (if you prefer not to register). Registration requires only an email address and a password. Guests provide an email address only. Both steps require email verification so that we can contact you about your request.</li>
<li>Provide request details: You will be asked to confirm your eligibility as a requester, provide an overview of your request and specify how you would like to receive your request (electronically, paper, view in person). You will also have the ability to provide any supporting documentation that could help the institution process your request.</li>
<li>Provide contact information: You will be asked to provide your contact information, including name, address, phone number, etc. so that you can be reached about your request. Also, in the event that your request must be sent to you via standard mail. This may occur if the request is too large to transmit via email.</li>
<li>Review request details: You will have the ability to review the details of your request and make any necessary changes before it is sent to the institution for processing.</li>
<li>Pay $5 processing fee: You will be directed to <a href="http://moneris.com">Moneris Solutions</a>, our payment processing partner to provide your credit card information to pay the $5 processing fee.</li>
<li>Once your payment is processed, you will return to this system and see a confirmation message. An email will be sent to you at the email address you verified earlier in the process, containing a summary of your request. You will then have the option of completing a short feedback questionnaire, exiting the system or submitting a new request.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Steps to make a personal information request:</h2>
<p>Below is an overview of the steps to completing a personal information request using the online system:</p>

<h2>
	Information available under the Access to Information and Privacy Acts</h2>
<p>If you are seeking access to government records generally, you can submit an access to information request under the Access to Information Act.</p>

<p>If you are seeking access to personal information held by a government institution, you can submit a request for personal information under the Privacy Act.</p>

<h3>
	Access to information request: For information about the government
	</h3>
<p>
	All government records (which include corporate documents and personal information) may be requested under the Access to Information Act. </p>

<p>Most government information is available. Major exceptions are Cabinet documents and information that could be injurious to Canada's security or economy, federal-provincial relations and international affairs. Information about individuals may be disclosed only with their consent or if it is found to be in the public interest. </p>

<p>The application fee for request made under that Access to Information Act is $5.00.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Access to Information Act is to provide a right of access to records under the control of a government institution to Canadian citizens, permanent residents, or any individual or corporation present in Canada.</p>

<h3>
	Eligibility to make a request under the Access to Information Act
		</h3>

<p>
 Canadian citizens, permanent residents and any individual present  or corporation in Canada can make a request under the Access to Information Act. Individuals who are neither of the above can ask a representative, who is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, to make a request on his/her behalf, provided there is written consent.
		</p>

<h3>
	Personal information request: For information about you or someone else
	</h3>
	<p>
Personal information is usually requested under the Privacy Act.</p>

<p>There are no fees charged for requests made under the Privacy Act.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Privacy Act is to protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves where it is held by a government institution and to provide individuals with the right to access such information.</p>

<p>Personal information which belongs to an individual who is not a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident of Canada or currently living in Canada must be requested under the Access to Information Act.
		</p>

<h3>
	Eligibility to make a request under the Privacy Act
		</h3>

<p>
	Canadian citizens, permanent residents and any individual present in Canada can make a request under the Privacy Act.
		</p>
<h3>
	Requesting someone else's personal information
	</h3>
<p>
	To obtain the personal information belonging to someone else, you must submit their written consent authorizing you to receive their personal information. The consent must be signed and dated by the person giving the consent. Permission is not required to obtain the information of any dependants who are under 18 years of age.
	</p>

<h3>
	Requesting personal information of someone who is deceased
	</h3>

<p>
	Personal information can be released if an individual has been deceased for 20 years or more. Reasonable proof of death must be provided. Examples of what constitutes reasonable proof include obituary notices, death certificates, photographs of tombstones and provincial vital statistics.</p> 
<p>If a person has been dead for less than 20 years, only the executor or executrix of the estate or, in the case of an individual who has died without a will, the administrator of the estate, may request the personal information of the deceased. The executor or administrator of the estate does not have an unlimited right of access to all of the deceased's personal information, but only that information which will allow them to fulfill their legal responsibilities to finalize the estate.
	</p>


<h2>Processing time</h2>

<p>
	Both Acts allow for a legal response time of 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of an official request. However, this period may be extended for limited and specific reasons identified in the Acts. For instance, extensions may be taken if:
<ul>
	<li>the request is for a large number of records or necessitates a search through a large number of records and meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the government institution;</li>
<li>consultations are necessary to comply with the request that cannot be completed within the original time limit; or</li>
<li>additional time is necessary for translation purposes or for converting personal information into an alternative format.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

<h2>
	Incomplete or unfulfilled request
	</h2>

<p>Some sensitive information is not available to members of the public under the Access to Information Act. If you requested this type of information, the institution will tell you why they cannot provide you some or all of the information you requested.</p>
