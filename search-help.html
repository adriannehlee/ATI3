<h1>Searching completed requests</h1>

<a href="search-summaries.html"><input type="button" value="Previous"></a>

<p>Government institutions publish summaries of completed Access to Information requests.</p>
<p>Before you create a new request, we suggest that you search for terms related to your request and browse through the results to see if the information you are looking for has already been released.</p>	
<p>If you do find a completed Access to Information request that matches the information you are looking for, you can make an informal request for that file. This process is often faster than submitting a new Access to Information request.</p>
<h2>How to order a completed request</h2>
<p>To make an informal request, click the "Make an informal request for..." link in the search results that corresponds to the file that you would like to request. You will be asked to provide your contact information, and your informal request will sent to the institution. The institution will then send you the completed request.</p>
