<h1>Making an online Access to information request</h1>
<h3>Overview of request process</h3>
<p>You will be directed through a series of steps to provide the details of your request:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search prior completed requests to see if the government has already released the information you want to request.</li>
<li>Select the institution you wish to ask for information.</li>
<li>Login, register or proceed as guest.</li>
<li>Provide request details. You will also have the ability to provide any supporting documentation that could help the institution process your request.</li>
<li>Provide contact information.</li>
<li>Review request details.</li>
<li>Pay $5 processing fee: You will be directed to the government's trusted and secure payment partner, <a href="http://moneris.com">Moneris Solutions</a>, to provide your credit card information to pay the $5 processing fee.</li>
<li>Once your payment is processed, you will return to this system and see a confirmation message.</li>
<li>An email will be sent to you at the email address you verified earlier in the process, containing a summary of your request.</li>
<li>You will then have the option of completing a short feedback questionnaire, exiting the system or submitting a new request.</li>
</ol>
